▪ Customer journeys across multiple channels often involve digital and physical interactions. Siloed channel  operations can create friction and hinder seamless customer experience (CX).   
▪ 60% of customers surveyed for the World Retail Banking Report 2024 said their bank’s self-service chatbot  experience was average.1 
▪ The same report revealed that only 32% of customers were satisfied with their bank’s customer contact  center experience.1 
Impact 
▪ By transitioning from a siloed multichannel to an end-to-end omnichannel customer interaction strategy,  banks can offer seamless start-anywhere-finish-anywhere customer journeys. 
▪ Omnichannel customer journeys enable banks to collect and leverage cross-channel customer insights to  tailor offerings and interactions to each customer’s preferences. 
▪ By actively understanding and mapping customer journeys across various channels, retail banks can  identify and address pain points to enhance CX. In turn, improved customer experience can foster greater  customer loyalty.

Bank’s channels often conflict with each  other, leading to friction in customer  journeys 
Banks offer a connected and  consistent experience across all  channels and products 
Banks connect data and processes  across channels for a seamless  experience at every customer  touchpoint  
With an omnichannel strategy, the  bank’s digital and physical channels  operate in synchrony 
acquisition ecosystem. This strategy  seamlessly integrates physical and digital  channels, enabling new customers to  initiate and complete the account opening  process through their preferred channel.1

▪ As banking shifts to digital platforms, consumers are frequently required to make financial decisions  independently. Yet, a 2024 Capital One survey revealed that only about 55% of Americans are  digitally financially literate, scoring high in both digital literacy and financial literacy.1   
▪ Increasingly, global regulators expect financial institutions to prioritize customer outcomes. In the UK, for  example, the Financial Conduct Authority’s Consumer Duty regulation mandates that firms ensure customers’  full comprehension of the financial products and services they purchase.2 
▪ The Capital One survey also revealed that 45% of US consumers prefer to manage their finances through a  mobile app.3 
Impact 
▪ Financial education informs bank customer behavior, resulting in improved credit scores and  less high-risk borrowing.  
▪ Financial literacy initiatives can help retail banks boost cross-selling. As customers develop a better  understanding and greater confidence in financial products such as investments and insurance, banks can  effectively cross-sell these offerings. 
▪ As the financial services industry undergoes digital transformation, retail banks can instill  customer confidence and loyalty through financial literacy efforts.

▪ A report on youth banking reveals that 57% of parents prefer a family digital wallet solution through their  existing banking provider.1  
▪ Research by Allied Analytics estimates that starter credit cards, primarily marketed at teenagers, could  generate USD 790 bn in revenue by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 10.6% from 2023 to 2032.2 
▪ Data services provider Cuscal estimates that in Australia alone, individuals aged 6 to 22 represent a  USD 825 billion total market size for retail banks.3 
▪ A 2024 Capital One survey found that 50% of US consumers (aged 18 - 24) scored high in digital literacy but  low in financial literacy.4 
Impact 
▪ By engaging with customers early and providing banking and education tools for youth, banks create a  foundation of trust that can lead to long-term loyalty. 
▪ With FinTech companies increasingly targeting younger users, incumbent banks can remain competitive  through enhanced offerings. A focused youth-banking strategy can help banks differentiate through  services that resonate with young digitally-savvy customers.  
▪ Banks that establish clear pathways for young customers to migrate to adult accounts can capitalize on the  youth-banking segment. Strategic banks proactively communicate transitions at key life stages to ensure  customer relationship continuity.

▪ To strengthen and harmonize cybersecurity and operational risk management regulations in Europe,  regulators created the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which requires banks and critical  third-party providers to implement robust IT security measures by January 2025.1 
▪ Research by Statista estimates that financial services firms lost an average of USD 6.1 million per data  breach in 2024, up from USD 5.9 million in 2023.2 
▪ Yet, an IMF survey of over 51 markets revealed that 56% of central banks lack a defined financial sector  cyber resilience strategy and 42% of markets lack dedicated cyber security or technology risk  management regulations.3 
Impact 
▪ Retail banks can increase customer confidence with a demonstrated focus on digital operational resilience.  Preventing data breaches and cyber attacks will help banks avoid reputational damage and regulatory action. 
▪ Retail banks with digital resilience plans can prevent costly disruptions from downtime and data  recovery efforts.  
▪ Retail banks that demonstrate a commitment to resilience can establish a competitive advantage over others  and attract customers who value security and reliability.

▪ A 2023 Reuters survey of global financial services firms revealed that over half of respondents said they  expected the time spent on compliance to increase in the next year.1 
▪ Laws governing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations have become  increasingly exhaustive, with Forrester estimating that the global cost of financial crime compliance has  reached USD 206 billion.2 
▪ New risks emerge for retail banks with the exponential growth of transaction volumes. Fenergo, a provider of  RegTech solutions, reported that in 2023, banks and financial institutions shelled out USD 6.6 billion in  fines for failing to comply with regulatory reporting and compliance rules.3 
Impact 
▪ As more retail banks adopt RegTech solutions, compliance and regulatory reporting is being automated. And  that means banks can react to regulatory changes quickly and cost effectively.  
▪ RegTechs can help turn compliance processes into a competitive advantage for retail banks by enabling the use  of sizeable regulatory data for fraud analytics and informing underwriting decisions. 
▪ RegTech solutions also enable retail banks to build resilience frameworks that help them proactively identify  and assess potential regulatory and fraud risks.

▪ A global reduction of money supply in the market by central banks (quantitative tightening*) in 2022 and  2023 has resulted in a significant outflow of deposits from banks. Additionally, high interest rates have also  increased the cost of capital for retail banks. 
▪ Despite exercising caution in expanding the money supply, central banks have begun a cycle of  interest rate reductions. The European Union initiated rate cuts in June 2024, followed by the US Federal  Reserve in September.1, 2 
▪ Findings from the Capgemini World Retail Banking Report 2024 indicate that retail bank executives rank the  high cost of capital and declining deposit volumes as the top two concerns.3 
Impact 
▪ Retail banks can offer bundled products that combine savings accounts with credit or investment options,  providing greater value to customers. 
▪ Targeting specific customer segments, including young professionals and retirement-age customers with  higher preference for liquid cash, retail banks stand to boost their deposit volumes. 
▪ As interest rates continue to decline, retail banks must cultivate stronger relationships with  price-insensitive customers. By consolidating their customer needs through retention and acquisition  incentives (cash bonuses, fee waivers, and reward programs), banks maintain their deposit volumes.

▪ Capgemini’s World Retail Banking Report 2024 explored delays in the KYC process for banking customers, with  64% of bank employees reporting that the process for each customer can take up to three days.1 
▪ Regulators globally are advocating for the adoption of digital identity tools for KYC processes. In April 2024,  the European Commission published the European Digital Identity Framework, requiring member states to  provide their citizens with a pan-European digital identity wallet by 2026.2 
▪ In September 2024, Gartner published research findings which predict that by 2026, at least 500 million users  will be using a digital identity wallet for KYC and verification claims.3 
Impact 
▪ Digital identity verification will enable banks to efficiently handle high volumes of customer  onboarding requests without the need for additional resources, facilitating easier scaling of operations as  demand increases. 
▪ Digital identity tools for KYC verification can also significantly decrease the time required for onboarding  customers, leading to increased conversion rates and supporting 24/7 account openings. 
▪ By utilizing digital identity management tools for onboarding and KYC processes, retail banks can also improve  accuracy and enhance fraud detection during the onboarding phase.

▪ AI in retail banking began with data-driven machine learning, advanced to new content generation with GenAI,  and is now closing in on agentic AI – systems that possess a degree of autonomy and can act on their own to  achieve specific goals. Autonomous agents will help banks personalize services and automate operations. 
▪ Domain-specific large language models (LLMs) are being developed for the financial industry to analyze  market data, understand financial regulations, and automate risk assessment, fraud detection, and  customer service.  
▪ Capgemini's World Retail Banking Report 2024 found that 70% of bank CXOs planned to increase digital  transformation investments by up to 10% in 2024.1 
Impact 
▪ According to Citi, AI could boost banking industry profits by USD 170 billion by 2028, enhancing  productivity through automation and streamlined operations.2 
▪ A 2023 NVIDIA survey found that 36% of financial services professionals reported AI applications reduced  their company's annual costs by more than 10%.3 
▪ Banks can optimize up to 66% of time spent on operational, documentation, and compliance-related  activities by leveraging AI-powered intelligent transformation projects, according to Capgemini research.4

▪ Regulations are encouraging financial services firms to power up ESG efforts. As part of Capgemini’s  “Embrace data to accelerate sustainability” report, 67% of executives said compliance is a key reason to  initiate ESG initiatives.1 
▪ Investments in ESG technology will unlock value beyond compliance. More than 72% of global financial firms  plan to spend ≥USD 500,000 on regulatory reporting, emissions data, and transitional  climate risk modeling, according to a 2024 Chartis Research study.2 
▪ Banks are responding to growing customer demand for ESG products. An Economist Impact report sponsored  by Temenos shows 73% of banks will offer more sustainable options in the next five years.3 
Impact 
▪ By embedding innovative ESG products and solutions into products, retail banks can win market differentiation to create a competitive advantage.  
▪ As investors continue to prioritize ESG considerations, sustainability products and services tailored to  individual customers will help banks foster deeper relationships.  
▪ Proactive use of ESG solutions can help retail banks bolster their reputation and brand image, while  staying ahead of the regulatory curve.

Leveraging open finance

▪ The European Commission’s Financial Data Access regulation (FiDA), expected to be finalized in 2025, establishes  a legal framework governing the access and use of customer data within the financial sector. The legislation aims  to foster data-driven innovation across sectors of the EU economy, including finance.1 
▪ In mid-2024, the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau suggested new rules aiming to allow consumers to  easily move their financial information between different financial institutions.2 
▪ Research by MX Technologies in 2023 found that 89% of US consumers want to control access to their  financial data.3 
Impact 
▪ With real-time access to comprehensive financial data, open finance allows banks to seamlessly integrate  customer information into a single platform, improving customer convenience. 
▪ A 360-degree view of bank customers’ finances gives firms opportunities to cross sell, offering personalized  savings and investment advice. 
▪ With access to comprehensive data sets, retail banks can develop more nuanced risk profiles for borrowers.  This can lead to better-informed lending decisions and potentially lower default rates, as banks are able to  identify reliable borrowers overlooked under traditional scoring models.
