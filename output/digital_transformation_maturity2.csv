"A Typology of Perspectives on Digital Transformation
The two aggregated thematic patterns of DT (i.e., towards malleable organizational 
designs and digital business ecosystems) summarize the content of DT, which focuses on 
‘the substance of contemporary organizational change’ (Armenakis and Bedeian, 1999, 
p. 295).",Organizational Change,1.0,"[('Digital Transformation', 'ORG'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('DT', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('DT', 'ORG'), ('Bedeian', 'GPE'), ('1999', 'DATE'), ('295', 'CARDINAL')]",Business Models,title: A Systematic Review of the Literature on Digital Transformation: Insights and Implications for Strategy and Organizational Change; creationDate: D:20220128162049+05'30'; modDate: D:20250430211400-07'00'; subject: J Management Studies 2021.58:1159-1197

beyond the boundaries of established perspectives on organizational change is that, due

This study proposes five strategic 
circumstances that often require 
business model innovation (BMI): 
(1) the opportunity to address 
through disruptive innovation 
the needs of large groups, (2) the 
opportunity to capitalize on a brand-
new technology by wrapping a new 
business model around it (Apple 
and MP3 players) or the opportunity 
to leverage a tested technology by 
bringing it to a whole new market, 
(3) the opportunity to bring a job-
to-be-done focus where one does 
not yet exist, (4) the need to fend 
off low-end disrupters, and (5) the 
need to respond to a shifting basis 
of competition

To survive “big-bang” disruptions 
such as new digital platforms, 
incumbents need to develop new 
tools to detect radical change in the 
offing, new strategies to slow down 
disrupters, new ways to leverage 
existing assets in other markets, 
and a more diversified approach to 
investment

In their introductory commentary to 
a MISQ Special Issue, the authors 
discuss four major implications for 
researchers interested in societal 
and business change in the context 
of information and communication 
technologies (ICTs): researchers 
(1) should expand their definitions 
of theory to include theories of the 
problem and theories of the solu-
tion, (2) explicitly define the ICT 
artifact, include affordances and 
constraints, and explicitly examine 
the unintended consequences 
of the ICT artifact, (3) consider 
emergent digital designing as a 
replacement for organizations, 
(4) couple research findings with 
public policy and regulation rec-

Results show that a primary reason 
why incumbents fail to identify new 
markets in the face of disruptive 
technologies and therefore lose 
their leadership is the inability to 
recognize either the rising ‘social’

products for fulfilling their need for 
friendship, or the ‘esteem’ market, 
where customers use products for

Case study (Interview with the man-

Finland
Regarding the implementation of a 
CE strategy, the following lessons 
can be drawn from the case study: 
(1) firms must analyze their history 
and their current way of doing busi-
ness, (2) employees must under-
stand what the firms stands for, now 
and in the future, (3) employee roles 
should be reorganized and rede-
fined to meet long-term business 
demands, and (4) in order to expand 
the entire market, cooperations 
with competitors might be worth 
considering

Although an increasing degree of 
autonomy among middle and 
operational managers has positive 
effects on CE, too much autonomy 
is harmful to the success of CE by 
unexpectedly encouraging oppor-
tunistic behaviors and decreasing 
perceived fairness (increasing

offer the opportunity to rethink the existing processes, services, and
products they have once created for the offline world:
“…is not only the digitalization of processes, which is of course neces-
sary, but also reinventing the whole activity using the opportunities of

When entering a digital transformation process, one third of the
public administrators highlight that they are able to change the work-
flow of their existing procedures and are able to rethink them in the
process:
“I see digital transformation for us, where we choose to digitize, our
workflows, or procedures that used to be, on paper, or physical work
flow.”

“That is the kind of digital transformation, in the outside world that we

“If you look at the latest developments, the administration will of course
have to make this change from fixed laptops and PCs to mobile devices.”
