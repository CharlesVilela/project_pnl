ABSTRACT  In this article we provide a systematic review of the extensive yet diverse and frag-
mented literature on digital transformation (DT), with the goal of clarifying boundary condi-
tions to investigate the phenomenon from the perspective of organizational change.",outros,1,,banco,
"On the 
basis of 279 articles, we provide a multi-dimensional framework synthesizing what is known 
about DT and discern two important thematical patterns: DT is moving firms to malleable 
organizational designs that enable continuous adaptation, and this move is embedded in and 
driven by digital business ecosystems.",outros,1,,banco,
"From these two patterns, we derive four perspectives on 
the phenomenon of DT: technology impact, compartmentalized adaptation, systemic shift and 
holistic co-evolution.",outros,1,,banco,
"Linking our findings and interpretations to existing work, we find that the 
nature of DT is only partially covered by conventional frameworks on organizational change.",outros,1,,banco,
"On the basis of this analysis, we derive a research agenda and provide managerial implications 
for strategy and organizational change.",outros,1,,banco,

organizational designs, systematic literature review
INTRODUCTION
Digital transformation (DT) is increasingly establishing itself as a constant theme in con-
temporary academic and practitioner conversations.",outros,1,,banco,
"Therefore, the phenomenon is naturally con-
nected to the topic of  organizational change, viewed as a ‘difference in form, quality, 
or state over time in an organizational entity’ (Van de Ven and Poole, 1995, p. 512).",outros,1,,banco,
"Thus, we define DT as organizational change that is triggered and shaped by the wide-
spread diffusion of  digital technologies.",outros,1,,banco,
"Such a view enables us to potentially explain 
the phenomenon of  DT and its management in business practice by drawing on the 
robust and diversified knowledge base relating to organizational change and innova-
tion (Poole and Van de Ven, 2004).",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"While prior research studied organizational change in relation to information 
technology (IT) (Markus and Robey, 1988; Orlikowski, 2000; Volkoff et al., 2007), the 
latter defined as ‘computer-based technology for the storage, accessing, processing and 
communication of information’ (Molloy and Schwenk, 1995, p. 283), and created valu-
able and persistent knowledge, recent observations suggest that DT deviates from these 
past organizational changes in at least the following ways.",outros,1,,banco,
"First, the technologies in-
volved, such as big data analytics, social media, mobile technology or cloud computing, 
seem very different from earlier IT (Bharadwaj et al., 2013).",infraestrutura_digital,4,,banco,
"Third, the consequences 
of DT – such as the emergence of new digital business models even in non-digital in-
dustries – seem to extend beyond those of previous phases of IT-enabled change, which 
were usually related to the practice level and rather incremental change within firms

"In summary and as indicated by recent works (e.g., Wessel et al., 
2020), it seems that the phenomenon of DT differs from past IT-related organizational 
change and cannot, therefore, be explained entirely using established theoretical models 
(Markus and Rowe, 2018).",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"Instead, DT seems to have a more intricate and encompass-
ing connection to the topic of organizational change, requiring a broader view of and 
comparison with the literature on organizational change and innovation (Poole and Van 
de Ven, 2004).",outros,1,,banco,
"Due to the uncertainties about the phenomenon, it is currently unclear whether, and if 
so how knowledge on organizational change can be used to explain DT.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"In other words, 
as the boundaries of the phenomenon are unclear, we cannot be sure whether DT is cov-
ered by existing knowledge of organizational change.",outros,1,,banco,
"And, how does DT relate 
to existing knowledge on organizational change?",outros,1,,banco,
"Accordingly, we aim to clarify the boundary conditions both phenomenologi-
cally and inductively (Post et al., 2020).",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"Second, this shift is embedded in and driven by digital business ecosystems.",outros,1,,banco,
"By connect-
ing these content patterns with the dimensions of context and process (Pettigrew, 1987), 
we derived four perspectives on DT: technology impact, compartmentalized adaptation, 
systemic shift and holistic co-evolution.",outros,1,,banco,
"Thus, 
we relate our findings particularly to the distinction in organizational change literature 
between episodic and continuous change perspectives, as this distinction is ‘sufficiently

"Whereas the episodic position relates to infrequent and 
intentional organizational change (Lewin, 1951; Poole and Van de Ven, 2004; Waeger 
and Weber, 2019), the continuous position assumes ‘ongoing, evolving and cumulative’ 
change (Weick and Quinn, 1999, p. 365).",outros,1,,banco,
"Finally, we derive a substan-
tial research agenda on the basis of our analysis of the fit between the phenomenon of 
DT and the established literature on organizational change and innovation.",outros,1,,banco,
"While there are multiple ways in which a literature review can make a theoretical 
contribution, this article aims to contribute via the clarification of boundary conditions, 
which is seen as critical for the advancement of research around a theory or topic (Post 
et al., 2020).",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"Third, we propose linkages between the phenomenon of DT and established views in 
management literature on organizational change and innovation and derive important 
avenues for future research.",outros,1,,banco,
"Overall, our review aims to help scholars to understand 
the phenomenon DT, encourage them to think differently about the phenomenon, and 
allow the development of novel and interesting empirical studies in subsequent research 
(Post et al., 2020).",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"Finally, our work aims to support managers to respond to the strategic 
challenge of DT (Singh et al., 2020) by revealing important insights on the shifts towards 
malleable organizational designs and digital business ecosystems that may inform orga-
nizational change and strategy practices.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"We selected the year 2000 
as the baseline for our search in order to gain robust insights into recent developments 
in the understanding of DT.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"The FT50 list contains high 
quality journals across a range of disciplines, such as the Journal of Management Studies 
or Organization Science, and was used as a representative and externally valid sample 
of top management journals (Biehl et al., 2006; Burgess and Shaw, 2010).",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"First, as is explained in more detail later on, it allowed us to cater to all 
four of the dimensions of organizational change, or ‘issues common to all change efforts’ 
(p. 293), named by Armenakis and Bedeian (1999), i.e., content, context, process and out-
comes (see explanation below).",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"An example of contextual conditions is the emergence and diffusion of cloud 
computing, as it is described as shaping and driving DT (e.g., Benlian et al., 2018).",infraestrutura_digital,4,,banco,
"In the 
category mechanisms we identified, for example, process models to describe and explain 
how small and medium enterprises drive DT in their companies (Li et al., 2017).",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"After applying the categories 
and sub-categories to about half the material, we again revised the category system 
by splitting up the sub-categories ‘into individual features or values’ (Mayring, 2014,  
p. 95).",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"For example, environmental antecedents were found to contain country charac-
teristics, industry characteristics and consumer characteristics.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"Finally, the prevailing discrepancies were discussed and unified by all four authors until 
agreements were reached on the allocations of all the articles.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"In the 
following section, we describe the findings of our review in detail.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"We found that so-called SMACIT tech-
nologies (social, mobile, analytics, cloud, and Internet of Things) (e.g., Sebastian et al., 
Figure 1.",infraestrutura_digital,4,,banco,
"Concurrently, the emergence and diffusion of digital technologies 
has led to an increased data availability, which in turn has increased the importance for 
organizations of machine learning and data analytics (Weichert, 2017).",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"These include the legal and infrastructural conditions of a country, 
such as regulatory frameworks and interventions (e.g., Cortet et al., 2016), but also tech-
nology-driven industry dynamics, including, among other things, the changing technological 
landscape of an industry (e.g., Alos-Simo et al., 2017).",outros,1,,banco,
"Consumers increasingly rely on 
digital technologies in their daily routines and personal interactions (e.g., Brynjolfsson 
et al., 2013), and expect ubiquitous access to virtual resources (e.g., Benlian et al., 2018).",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"We identified two main mechanisms used by organizations 
to conceive and bring about DT: innovation and integration (Daniel and Wilson, 2003; 
Henfridsson and Yoo, 2013).",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"Mobilization for and acceleration of  digital transformation by TMTs 
is another critical activity at the strategic level, and is used, among other things, to attract 
a new generation of workers (e.g., Matzler et al., 2018) and to establish digital mindsets 
(e.g., Hansen et al., 2011).",outros,1,,banco,
"With a more operational focus but embedded in the strategic 
orientation, the exploitation and leveraging of  digital capabilities is important for organizations, 
mainly regarding online informational capabilities (Barua et al., 2004), big data analyt-
ics capabilities (e.g., Hausladen and Zipf, 2018) and digital platform capabilities (e.g., 
Karimi and Walter, 2015).",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"This also includes merging human-ma-
chine interaction as a core activity to establish value-adding and sustainable synergies be-
tween technology and humans (Bajer, 2017).",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"First, developing a digital transformation strategy that ‘serves as a cen-
tral concept to integrate the entire coordination, prioritization, and implementation of 
digital transformations within a firm’ (Matt et al., 2015, p. 339) is key to marshalling 
this integration in the course of DT.",outros,1,,banco,
"Executions of such plans involve activities to unlock 
organizations, for example by developing dynamic capabilities (e.g., Karimi and Walter, 
2015) and enhanced organizational learning abilities (e.g., Schuchmann and Seufert, 
2015).",outros,1,,banco,
"To start with, we 
found that a focus on open innovation and crowdsourcing leads to more ecosystem-oriented 
and -embedded organizations (Berman and Marshall, 2014).",outros,1,,banco,
"This shift continues in the in-
tra-organizational structuring: organizations develop permeable, agile organizational structures, 
and in doing so become agile, adaptable and boundaryless, as manifested in organiza-
tional forms such as Holacracy (e.g., Schwer and Hitz, 2018).",outros,1,,banco,
"This is evidenced by 
the increased use of artificial intelligence support and decision support systems (e.g., 
Kolbjørnsrud et al., 2016).",outros,1,,banco,
"In a similar vein, digital and customer experience-focused business 
models gain importance.",experiencia_cliente,3,,banco,
"Finally, DT in organizations culminates in the outcome of automatized, 
data-driven and virtual business processes through an enhanced use of digital technologies and 
software for performing tasks (e.g., Dery et al., 2017), as well as the development of smart, 
connected and customized products (e.g., Porter and Heppelman, 2015).",outros,1,,banco,
"These spill-overs – divided into paradigms, systems, industry, information secu-
rity and individual effects – form the environment with which firms interact to remain 
legitimate and successful.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"DT thereby causes a blurring of  the 
boundaries between physical and online industry structures, including the convergence of physical 
products and digital services, merging the physical world with online content, and creat-
ing an omnichannel environment for the customer (e.g., Brynjolfsson et al., 2013).",experiencia_cliente,5,,banco,
"DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS
Although our findings portray DT as complex and diversified, we can abstract directions 
concerning the content of organizational change (Armenakis and Bedeian, 1999).",outros,1,,banco,
"In particular, 
we observe the move towards malleable organizational designs that are embedded in and 
driven by digital business ecosystems.",outros,1,,banco,
"(2017) say, in summary, that digital firms adapt rapidly though the mechanisms of 
data-driven operation (e.g., fine-grained monitoring and user profiling based on digital 
technologies), swift transformation (e.g., fast redefinition of core markets, identities and 
activities) and instant release (e.g., dynamic innovation of digital offerings based on cus-
tomer feedback).",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"For in-
stance, data-driven operations and decision making are underpinned by automatized, 
data-driven and virtual business processes, as well as technology-focused and -supported 
management.",outros,1,,banco,
"Finally, the outcomes of digital and customer experience-focused digital 
business models and of smart connected and customized products can be related to the 
mechanism of instant release, as these are dynamically adaptable and scalable market 
offerings.",experiencia_cliente,3,,banco,
"For instance, by engaging in digital innovation, 
new digital business models are established that allow for instant release.",outros,1,,banco,
"By building on 
new digital capabilities and human-machine interaction, data-driven operations can be 
achieved.",outros,1,,banco,
"Developing a digital business strategy, digital acceleration and digital mobiliza-
tion help to unfreeze the organization for swift transformation.",outros,1,,banco,
"Here digital firms and non-digital firms 
diverge, as the latter have to deal with a pre-existing organizational design, requiring a 
digital transformation strategy and physical-digital harmonizing, while digital firms are 
regularly built from scratch (Tumbas et al., 2017).",outros,1,,banco,
"Data-driven operations and decisions tune the firm to environmental feedback, 
for instance from customers, by utilizing the potential of AI and machine learning to 
automatically detect and react to changes.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"This is termed ‘digital ecodynamics’, a 
phenomenon that ‘has no separations among its three core elements, but it is the whole-
ness of the fused interactions among the three elements’ (El Sawy et al., 2010, p. 837).",outros,1,,banco,
"Towards Digital Business Ecosystems
Drawing upon the manifold changes that our review has revealed with regards to an-
tecedents and outcomes, in conjunction with the emergence of malleable organizational 
designs that dynamically tune firms to their environments, we can identify a move towards 
digital business ecosystems as the second thematic pattern of DT.",outros,1,,banco,
"Business ecosystems 
are often seen as underpinning the value creation and capture of firms, representing ‘the 
alignment structure of the multilateral set of partners that need to interact in order for a 
focal value proposition to materialize’ (Adner, 2017, p. 42).",outros,1,,banco,
"As they shape firm decisions 
about where and how to compete, business ecosystems are an essential topic for strategy 
(Jacobides et al., 2018).",outros,1,,banco,
"In recent decades, we have seen numerous companies moving 
away from hierarchical integrated supply chains and towards these more fragmented net-
works of strategic partnerships with external entities (Bitran et al., 2007).",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"However, in the 
course of DT, we contend that through the holistic confluence comprising material, or-
ganizational and further environmental dimensions (El Sawy et al., 2010), so-called digital 
business ecosystems, which in the past were only a topic of interest for IT and software 
industries, are becoming more and more inseparable from regular business ecosystems 
and increasingly relevant across sectors as digital technologies diffuse through industries 
and society.",outros,1,,banco,
"Digital business ecosystems define business environments ‘shaped by a net-
work of interdependencies specifically generated through digital technologies’ (Kopalle 
et al., 2020, pp.",outros,1,,banco,
"A key differential factor that sets digital business ecosystems 
apart is their turbulent nature (El Sawy and Perreira, 2013).",outros,1,,banco,
"In the context of business ecosystems, this turbulence becomes

Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd
visible especially through the vast number and heterogeneity of interdependent part-
ners that shape competition (e.g., Jacobides et al., 2018), the widespread diffusion and 
adoption of interconnected generative technologies (e.g., Kopalle et al., 2020), and the 
constantly changing customer preferences (e.g., Downes and Nunes, 2013).",outros,1,,banco,
"For instance, we identified that DT is triggered and shaped by a plethora 
of diverse digital technologies and applications, such as blockchain technologies, AI and 
the Internet of Things.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"Also, consumers are increasingly embedding technology within 
their daily routines and personal interactions, which has profound implications for their 
demands and expectations towards the offerings of and the communications with firms.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"In the outcomes category, we can see, among other things, a 
shift towards connected markets in which the participants are involved in numerous ex-
change networks that are easily formed, grown, and dissolved again.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"This can mainly be 
attributed to the ubiquity of the Internet and other related technologies on which these 
networks heavily rely, leading overall to digitally permeated markets.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"Due to the increasing turbulence, digital business ecosystems are ‘changing the rules 
of the game in many industries through disruptions of business models’ (Pagani, 2013, 
p. 617).",outros,1,,banco,
"The resulting non-linearity and equifinality may make these 
ecosystems better understood from configurational theory (El Sawy et al., 2010; Meyer 
et al., 1993).",outros,1,,banco,
"As a further result of their turbulent nature, digital business ecosystems also diverge 
from regular business ecosystems with regard to their constituents.",outros,1,,banco,
"Following the defi-
nition of Adner (2017), regular business ecosystems are, characterized by, among other 
things, a set of partners with ‘defined positions and activity flows among them’ (p. 42), 
based on a collectively pursued value proposition.",outros,1,,banco,
"Within digital business ecosystems, 
however, the value propositions pursued can change radically in a short period of time 
(Yoo et al., 2012).",outros,1,,banco,
"Thus, the participants within digital business ecosystems, their posi-
tions, and their roles are subject to constant change.",outros,1,,banco,
"Thus, it is becoming increasingly complex 
to maintain an overview of the value propositions pursued and the participants within 
digital business ecosystems, and to determine their positions and the activity flows among 
them.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"A Typology of Perspectives on Digital Transformation
The two aggregated thematic patterns of DT (i.e., towards malleable organizational 
designs and digital business ecosystems) summarize the content of DT, which focuses on 
‘the substance of contemporary organizational change’ (Armenakis and Bedeian, 1999, 
p. 295).",outros,1,,banco,
"Following literature from the field of organizational change (e.g., Pettigrew, 2012; 
Sminia and de Rond, 2012), it is necessary to consider the content in conjunction with 
the context and process dimensions.",outros,1,,banco,
"Traditionally, scholars in the field 
of organizational change distinguished between inner contexts (i.e., structures, corporate 
cultures and political context within firms) and outer contexts (i.e., the social, economic, 
political and competitive environment of a firm) (Pettigrew, 1987).",outros,1,,banco,
"Furthermore, the change towards a 
malleable organizational design is embedded in and driven by digital business ecosystems 
and cannot be considered in isolation from this.",outros,1,,banco,
"The contextual scope can be 
rather narrow if the focus is on the relationship between specific elements from digital 
business ecosystems and particular aspects of the organizational design.",outros,1,,banco,
"(2017) focus in their study on the impact of AI on the nature of work 
and the execution of processes in organizations.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"Conversely, the contextual scope can 
be rather broad if the holistic confluence of multiple technological, organizational and 
environmental elements in digital business ecosystems, as well as their interactions with 
organizational design as a whole, is considered.",outros,1,,banco,
"The metaphor of an optical lens (Van de Ven and Hargrave, 
2004), which either ‘zooms in’ and focuses on specific aspects and changes related to 
contextual conditions and outcomes of DT or ‘zooms out’ to observe the phenomenon 
in a broader context, can be used here to describe the contextual scope in relation to digital 
business ecosystems and malleable organizational designs.",outros,1,,banco,
"Journal of Management Studies published by Society for the Advancement of Management 
Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd
related to digital business ecosystems and their relation to organizational designs, to being 
‘broad’ in scope and examining both thematic patterns of DT in a more holistic way.",outros,1,,banco,
"When considering this dimension, researchers 
on organizational change typically focus on intra-organizational actors and actions (e.g., 
Armenakis and Bedeian, 1999; Sminia and de Rond, 2012).",outros,1,,banco,
"However, as we discussed 
previously, change processes in the course of DT are driven not only by organizational 
actors, but by a confluence of organizational, technological and environmental forces 
in digital business ecosystems (El Sawy et al., 2010).",outros,1,,banco,
"Some studies in our consideration set put more emphasis on 
change processes driven by developments outside of a firm’s direct area of control, such 
as the increasing diffusion of AI, robotics and the Internet, and described their effect 
on organizational design, without dealing in detail with the intra-organizational change 
involved to bring about these effects (e.g., Evans, 2017).",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"This dimension can vary along a 
continuum from a ‘weak focus’ to a ‘strong focus’ on intra-organizational change pro-
cesses, depending on the emphasis placed on an organization’s innovation and integra-
tion mechanisms as drivers towards malleable organization designs and digital business 
ecosystems.",outros,1,,banco,
"By juxtaposing the two dimensions of contextual scope and intra-organizational change 
process based on our definitions, a two-by-two typology that delineates four distinct per-
spectives on DT emerges (see Figure 3).",outros,1,,banco,
"These four perspectives are technology impact, 
compartmentalized adaptation, systemic shift and holistic co-evolution.",outros,1,,banco,
"It should be stressed that each and every 
perspective assumes organizational change in association with the widespread diffusion 
of digital technologies.",outros,1,,banco,
"The technology impact perspective on DT combines a weak focus on intra-organizational 
change processes with a narrow contextual scope.",outros,1,,banco,
"(2018) 
describe how the diffusion of the blockchain technology leads to the development of 
new business models across several industries.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"The main strength of studies 
that follow this perspective is that they reveal important insights into what is really new 
about digital technologies and innovations, and that they clarify partial contributions to

"In the same sense, insights about par-
ticular outcomes – such as increased business process efficiency through the use of AI 
– must be related to potential higher-level spill-overs such as exposure to cyber threats.",inteligencia_artificial,3,,banco,
"In 
general, these studies do not provide insights about how organizations arrive at malleable 
organizational designs but reveal particular forces from digital business ecosystems that 
alter certain parts of organizations.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"(2013) describe how online 
and offline retailers can successfully take advantage of developments related to mobile 
and augmented reality technologies to improve their interactions with their customers.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"(2017) derive a process model explaining how small and medium-sized 
Figure 3.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"Here, we can learn, for instance, 
how organizations evolve in response to particular triggers towards data-driven opera-
tions and decision-making.",outros,1,,banco,
"For 
instance, one might explain the success of a firm in managing change associated with 
a specific technology, while concurrently observing the overall downturn of the firm or 
industry as a whole due to the widespread diffusion of digital technologies across society.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"In summary, this perspective provides insights on how firms partially adapt their organi-
zations to specific developments in their digital business ecosystems.",outros,1,,banco,
"The systemic shift perspective on DT is employed by studies that have a weak focus 
on intra-organizational change processes, as with the technology impact perspective, 
but combine it with a rather broad contextual scope.",outros,1,,banco,
"Such work thereby describes how 
conditions within digital business ecosystems interact with organizational designs as a 
whole.",outros,1,,banco,
"Hence, studies following this perspective help us 
to understand the peculiarities and evolutions of digital business ecosystems as a whole 
and their impacts on organizational designs.",outros,1,,banco,
"However, the systemic shift perspective does 
not describe how organizations achieve adaptations to and interactions with their respec-
tive business environments.",outros,1,,banco,
"Finally, the holistic co-evolution perspective on DT combines a strong focus on intra-or-
ganizational change processes with a rather broad contextual scope.",outros,1,,banco,
"Works following this perspective contribute to 
research on DT by yielding insights into how organizations transform their organiza-
tional design in accordance with the surrounding evolving digital business ecosystems.",outros,1,,banco,
"Furthermore, examining DT from such a holistic perspective could come at 
the cost of reduced detail concerning particular elements as, for example, peculiarities 
of specific digital technologies cannot be examined and considered to the same extent as 
with the technology impact perspective.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"For instance, a study following the holistic co-evolution 
perspective might illustrate the ‘big picture’ and reveal aspects which seem to be of par-
ticular importance, which could then be combined with a technology impact type study 
in which these aspects are examined in greater detail.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"While there are multiple frameworks that differentiate orga-
nizational change in this way, our findings reveal a special connection to the distinction 
between episodic and continuous change (Weick and Quinn, 1999), most notably be-
cause the dynamics of change denotes a common theme in both the aforementioned the-
matic patterns.",outros,1,,banco,
"That is, malleable organizational design places a premium on constant 
adaptation and change in correspondence to the environment (Huang et al., 2017), and 
the digital business ecosystems in which organizations are embedded are characterized 
by their ever-evolving and turbulent nature (El Sawy et al., 2010).",outros,1,,banco,
"Accordingly, to clarify 
boundary conditions to investigate DT from the perspective of organizational change, 
it seems promising to contrast our findings with the characteristics of episodic and con-
tinuous change, particularly with respect to the ‘different metaphors of the organization, 
analytical frameworks, theories of intervention, and roles attributed to change agents’ 
(Poole, 2004, p. 5).",outros,1,,banco,
"First, the extant literature differentiates continuous and episodic change by the respec-
tive metaphor of  the organization.",outros,1,,banco,
"In addition, data-driven operations and decisions might, at the 
very least, mitigate cognitive sources of inertia (Besson and Rowe, 2012).",outros,1,,banco,
"Journal of Management Studies published by Society for the Advancement of Management 
Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd
With regard to the analytic framework characteristics (Poole, 2004), episodic change 
literature takes macro-level perspectives and sees change as punctuated by occasional 
external events, affecting internal deep structures and leading to revolutionary change in-
volving replacement to reach a new equilibrium.",outros,1,,banco,
"Continuous change, in contrast, utiliz-
ing micro-level perspectives, focuses more on endless local, smaller adaptations emerging 
from improvisations in internal practice that may aggregate over time (Weick and Quinn, 
1999).",outros,1,,banco,
"Last, when looking at the outcomes, we identi-
fied that practically every sphere of an organization can but not necessarily has to be 
affected, illustrating that firms attempt to achieve or remain fit with the contextual con-
ditions, leading to new socio-organizational configurations (Avgerou, 2001), which may 
require incremental to fundamental adaptations depending on the context.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"Having said that, our results 
also indicate that for DT, there might as well be deviations from the regular templates 
of continuous and episodic change (Weick and Quinn, 1999).",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"This is particularly the 
case due to the new complexity stemming from the increasing interconnectedness of 
various and dispersed actors in digital business ecosystems.",outros,1,,banco,
"In the words of El Sawy and 
Perreira (2013, p. 2), ‘[u]nlike other business environments, digital business ecosystems 
can never be expected to revert to any kind of “equilibrium” after disruptions change 
things; turbulence implies that cause-and-effect may cascade in unpredictable ways to 
alter the structure or health of the ecosystem, or end it entirely’.",outros,1,,banco,
"Thus, while DT is as-
sociated with disruptions, known from episodic change conceptions, these are no longer 
infrequent and do not end in a new era of stability.",outros,1,,banco,
"With regard to the respective intervention theory, episodic change assumes change evolving 
by phases of unfreezing, changing and refreezing in a planned and intentional manner, 
while the continuous perspective follows a freeze, rebalance, unfreeze logic where change 
exists irrespective of intention (Weick and Quinn, 1999).",outros,1,,banco,
"Again, as can be seen in the innovation mechanisms, no matter how incremental 
or fundamental the respective change is, we can diagnose a higher importance of digital

"Due to the specific nature of digital technologies (Kallinikos et 
al., 2013), particularly the generativity they induce inside and beyond organizations (Yoo 
et al., 2012), we contend that even episodic phases of DT trigger continuous changes.",outros,1,,banco,
"This is also underscored by the fact that firms are increasingly embedded in and interwo-
ven with digital business ecosystems that are inherently turbulent (El Sawy and Perreira, 
2013).",outros,1,,banco,
"Put differently, in the context of DT, the idea of refreezing, as 
the final step in the schematic Lewinian change processes of episodic change (Weick and 
Quinn, 1999), is challenged and may culminate in a state of constant unfreezing.",outros,1,,banco,
"Finally, concerning the change agent, episodic change assumes a change agent that needs 
to radically alter mind-sets within the organization to create change (Weick and Quinn, 
1999).",outros,1,,banco,
"However, again, when we look at the outcomes of DT and the higher level of 
flexibility the malleable organizational design implies, we see change agents following the 
continuous paradigm as a new constant.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"Though, especially in the beginning of DT and 
due to the unpredictable evolution of digital business ecosystems in later phases, change 
agents from the perspective of episodic change will also be necessary.",outros,1,,banco,
"What is unique to DT and going 
beyond the boundaries of established perspectives on organizational change is that, due 
to the traits of digital technologies underlying the new organizational design and digi-
tal business ecosystems, even these episodic episodes lead to new phases of continuous 
change in organizations, which may endure for a comparably long time.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"This path profits from the established the-
oretical models as a robust basis from which to better understand and explain the phe-
nomenon.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"Our review revealed that conceptions of 
continuous change are generally suitable, with some constraints.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"We, therefore, discuss 
in the following how theories that are classified as belonging to the continuous change 
 14676486, 2021, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joms.12639 by Capes, Wiley Online Library on [30/04/2025].",outros,1,,banco,
"Furthermore, theories that combine elements of both continuous 
and episodic change (Poole, 2004) seem particularly valuable.",outros,1,,banco,
"First, while we 
find that continuous change perspectives generally fit the phenomenon of DT well, we 
also identified some variations in this fit, particularly with regard to taking into account 
the actions of external actors, and when also employing macro perspectives.",outros,1,,banco,
"Second, 
while we strongly associate DT with a shift towards continuous change, we also con-
cluded that this shift might be triggered and shaped by episodic bursts.",outros,1,,banco,
"Episodic change 
perspectives might thus be valuable, with the adaption of not assuming an end-state 
or freezing period.",outros,1,,banco,
"It is important to note that a detailed review of each 
of the aforementioned theories is beyond the scope of this study, although the analysis 
of their basic tenets in the light of DT generates valuable stimulants for future research.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"When employing the DT perspective of technology impact, continuous theories of insti-
tutional diffusion (Van de Ven and Hargrave, 2004) might be very helpful.",outros,1,,banco,
"Furthermore, technology structuration theories (Orlikowski, 2000) might be valu-
able for tracing the consequences of interactions with digital technologies in relation 
to organizational change.",outros,1,,banco,
"For instance, heterogeneous and dispersed external software devel-
opers have been found to alter the value creation structures of focal companies (Parker 
et al., 2017), while other consequences concerning organizational change remain unex-
plored.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"However, when using such lenses, it is important to 
incorporate the specific traits of digital technologies.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"Here, creative accumulation theory (Bergek et al., 2013) seems very promis-
ing as it allows revolutionary and evolutionary technology consequences to be explained, 
and thereby reconciles thoughts from both the episodic and the continuous perspectives.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,

"It is also interesting to investigate how such theoretical relations play 
out when new actors are non-human, such as robots or AI-based systems.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"In a similar 
vein, one might ask if theories relating to organizational learning (Vera et al., 2011) need 
to be adapted to the new realities of DT, where learning is more and more data-driven, 
potentially automatized and tuned to the external environment.",outros,1,,banco,
"Thus, while data-driven 
operations have the potential to detect and correct errors independently (so-called ‘single 
loop learning’), with the rise of AI, this might also radiate to higher levels of learning.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"This data-based automation and AI might 
question human agency in organizational learning.",inteligencia_artificial,4,,banco,
"Relatedly, questions regarding the 
idea of dynamic capabilities (Teece, 1997) arise.",outros,1,,banco,
"As for the particular dynamic nature of these digital 
operational capabilities (Kallinikos et al., 2013), the difference between ordinary and 
dynamic capabilities might vanish, as capabilities based on digital technology are very 
easily adaptable.",outros,1,,banco,
"Future research might investigate whether DT leads to the seemingly 
contradictory result that firms adapt faster than ever on the basis of flexible ordinary 
capabilities, while the need for dynamic capabilities in the traditional sense shrinks.",outros,1,,banco,
"When employing the DT perspective of systemic shift, continuous views from popu-
lation and community ecologies (Baum and Rao, 2004) seem adequate for investigat-
ing how new digital organizational forms (Hinings et al., 2018) emerge and become 
institutionalized across fields and ecosystems.",outros,1,,banco,
"Furthermore, theories of collective action (Van de Ven and Hargrave, 2004) 
seem promising given the importance of digital business ecosystems.",outros,1,,banco,
"However, future 
research should scrutinize necessary adaptations because collective action is no longer a 
punctual event, but a constant, never-ending process in digital business ecosystems which 
involves ever-changing groups of actors.",outros,1,,banco,
"When employing the DT perspective of holistic co-evolution, theories of institutional 
design (Van de Ven and Hargrave, 2004) can be very helpful for learning how organiza-
tional actions and actors are interacting with the surrounding digital business ecosystem.",outros,1,,banco,
"For instance, the internal change processes of an organization from a pipeline towards a 
platform company may significantly shape and be shaped by the business environments, 
partner networks, etc.",outros,1,,banco,
"Furthermore, using the lens of culture 
change (Hatch, 2004), future research should investigate how the increasing embedded-
ness in global, cross-industry and large scale digital business ecosystems involving intense 
and ongoing interactions with heterogeneous actors (Yoo et al., 2012) leads to dynam-
ics in organizational culture.",outros,1,,banco,
"Here, it seems interesting to see if strong cultures can serve as a connective 
tissue holding the dynamics of malleable organizational designs and turbulent digital 
business ecosystems together (Weick and Quinn, 1999).",outros,1,,banco,
"First, in the spirit of Armenakis and 
Bedeian (1999), it is important to assess certain criterion variables, such as performance 
and employee satisfaction, to investigate the efficacy of change efforts.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"As our analysis has revealed, while 
certain accounts seem to fit DI well, others should be adapted.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"Furthermore, 
our analysis of the organizational change literature was tightly coupled to the distinction 
of episodic vs. continuous change.",outros,1,,banco,
"Journal of Management Studies published by Society for the Advancement of Management 
Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd
DT, for instance with regard to synthesizing divergent interests both within organizations 
and digital business ecosystems.",outros,1,,banco,
"Furthermore, the process of coding 
the articles was performed by hand, and so could be subject to subjectivity, although we 
aimed to prevent this by relying on multiple coders and several rounds of scrutinizing 
the coding.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"Fourth, 
regarding the discussion, we based our thoughts on the episodic vs. continuous change 
distinction, as we identified its value for understanding DT.",outros,1,,banco,
"Managerial Implications
Next to the aforementioned implications for research, this study also provides valuable 
insights into managerial practice with respect to organizational change and strategy.",outros,1,,banco,
"We can witness this phenomenon for example in the 
current COVID-19 pandemic that simultaneously highlights the potential as well as the 
necessity of malleable organizational designs: regulatory measures to contain the spread 
of the virus such as lockdowns and limited person-to-person contacts are forcing new 
digital ways of collaboration (e.g., through tools such as Zoom or Slack), service delivery 
models (e.g., through the adoption of AI and robotic process automation), and customer 
relationship management (e.g., through harnessing digital channels) (KMPG, 2020; 
McKinsey, 2020; strategy&, 2020).",inteligencia_artificial,4,,banco,
"Hence, the ideas and topics related to DT such as automatized, data-driven and virtual 
business processes or ecosystem-oriented and embedded organizations are not simply 
academic, but of high relevance in practice as well since they provide insights into key 
questions of organizational change and strategy such as how to adapt organizations,

"As we pointed out, DT involves, on the one hand a shift toward malleable organizational 
designs that enable continuous adaptation and on the other, toward turbulent digital 
business ecosystems.",outros,1,,banco,
"To account 
for this complexity in assessing the contextual conditions, managers should pro-actively 
use support from data-analytics.",outros,1,,banco,
"Current and future DT studies on technology impact and 
systemic shift are best suited to informing DT awareness.",outros,1,,banco,
"This refers to the intellectual 
capacity to continuously conceive novel digital processes and products based on the avail-
able internal and external resources, as well as the willingness to invest both managerial 
attention and financial resources in times of episodic bursts.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"Above all, it is important to 
understand that fast execution and experimentation to learn in the market are superior 
to ex-ante planning and analysis due to the dynamic nature of digital business ecosystems 
and the transience of competitive positions and advantages.",outros,1,,banco,
"This skill can be informed 
and further developed with studies in the realm of holistic co-evolution.",outros,1,,banco,
"Third, managers require DT harmonizing skills with regards to organizational change 
processes.",outros,1,,banco,
"These are again related to the mechanisms in the multi-dimensional frame-
work, but with a focus on integration.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"We propose that those firms which ensure that the 
aforementioned three leadership skills are present and sustained in their organization are 
best prepared to master the challenges of DT.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"At the same time, however, there 
still exist considerable uncertainties about what DT is and encompasses.",inteligencia_artificial,1,,banco,
"As a result, build-
ing on prior knowledge on organizational change to better understand the phenomenon 
and give informed advice to practice is problematic.",outros,1,,banco,
"We define 
DT as organizational change triggered and shaped by the widespread diffusion of digital 
technology.",outros,1,,banco,
"The content of this change, we find, comprises a move towards malleable or-
ganizational designs that are embedded in and driven by digital business ecosystems.",outros,1,,banco,
"This 
content of change can be viewed from four different perspectives, including a technology 
impact, compartmentalized adaptation, systemic shift and holistic co-evolution perspective.",outros,1,,banco,
"The perspectives vary in their contextual scope and focus on intra-organizational change 
processes but share the commonality that they associate organizational change with the na-
ture of digital technologies, particularly their pervasiveness and the dynamics they induce.",outros,1,,banco,
"Linking our findings to the established knowledge on organizational change, we diagnose 
that DT can be best understood as continuous change that can be triggered and shaped by 
episodic bursts, while the latter are inducing further continuous change.",outros,1,,banco,
